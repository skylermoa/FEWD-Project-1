        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am married to my wonderful husband who has brought the two most amazing children into my life. I was born and raised in Idaho, but I've had the opportunity to live in Central America where I learned Spanish. That experience gave me a love for languages. </p>
        <p>Even though I am getting older, I never saw myself leaving the student stage. I always felt the need to learn something new and exciting.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies/Interests</h2>
        <p>In General I love being on the computer. Weather it's playing games, watching YouTube videos, or working on projects, computers are one of my biggest interests. I love to read, specifically young adult fiction. Some of my favorites are Harry Potter, Fablehaven, Dragonwatch, and The Hunger Games.</p>
        <p>Being in Idaho I enjoy the outdoors as well. Never been a fan of camping, but nature walks, hikes, swimming, and exploring in nice weather have been some of my more relaxing hobbies.</p>
